Assignment2: Debug Report

Issue:
When running code: unexpected line stop at line18 (see picture)
 
Resulting in errors for calculations on line 4, 26, 36.

Fixed:
Code at line18 read as “500” instead of the integer 500. Can’t calculate non-numeric strings.  Quotations removed, code runs.
 

Additions:
Reworked code through line0 to provide error messages that display incorrect values in the tuple, dictionary, list.

Result:
Code works as intended. Errors displaying useful suggestions implemented.
